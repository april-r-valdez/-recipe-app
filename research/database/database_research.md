# Database Research

## Reasons for doing database
-  We want our user's data entries and generated recipes to be stored in a secure system that provides both scalability and accessibility

## Learning opportunities
- How to effectively store and retrieve data from database
- Understand CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MySQL 
- Understand the type of database we want to manage (relational vs non-relational)

## Expectations
- We expect to implement mySQL into our project's backend code

## Associated Jira tasks related to database
- As a user, I want to save my recipes so I can look at them later
