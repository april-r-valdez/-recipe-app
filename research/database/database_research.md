# Database Research

## Reasons for creating database

- We want our user's data entries and generated recipes to be stored in a secure system that provides both scalability and accessibility

## Learning opportunities

- How to effectively store and retrieve data from database
- Understand CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in MySQL
- Understand the type of database we want to manage (relational vs non-relational)

## Expectations

- We expect to implement mySQL into our project's backend code

## Some potential databases to use

- [MySQL] MySQL is a relational database that organizes and stores data in well-defined tables with rows and columns
- [CloudFireStore] Cloud Firestore is a non relational, flexible, scalable database from Firebase and Google Cloud

## Associated Jira tasks related to database

- As a user, I want to save my recipes so I can look at them later
