# API Research

## Reason for using third-party APIs

- We want our users to be able to conveniently browse various recipes based on the ingredients they have
- Using third-party APIs can potentially speed up the development process
- Third-party APIs are designed to handle a large number of requests and users, which can help our app scale more easily.

## Some limitation of using third-party APIs

- The app's functionality relies on external services. For example, if the third-party API is down for maintainance, it can affect our app
- While some APIs offer free tiers, others require some fees as the usage increases

## Learning opportunities

- How to fetch JSON data using APIs call
- How to process the fetched data and send them to the frontend

## Some potential APIs that could be integrated into our Recipe App

- [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs): searching for recipes based on name, ingredients, etc.
- [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php): searching for meal based on name

## Expectations

- We expect to call third-party APIs from the backend of our app, process the response data and send it to the frontend.

## Associated Jira tasks

- As a user, I would like to have choices of existing recipes that I can cook from the list of ingredients
